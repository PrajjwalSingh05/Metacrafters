#NFT Minting Program

* This JavaScript program allows users to manage Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) through basic functionalities:

* Mint NFTs: Users can create new NFTs by providing metadata such as title, unique code, artist name, year of creation, and painting medium. The program stores these NFTs in an array.

* List NFTs: Users can view a list of all minted NFTs along with their metadata. This function iterates through the array of NFTs and prints each NFT's details to the console.

* Get Total Supply: Users can retrieve the total number of minted NFTs. This function simply prints the length of the array, indicating the total supply of NFTs.

The program provides a basic demonstration of NFT management functionalities and serves as an introduction to NFT concepts in JavaScript.
